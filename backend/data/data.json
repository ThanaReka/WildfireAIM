    "question": "What is prescribed burning?",
    "answer": "Prescribed burning, also known as controlled burning, is a fire management technique used to reduce the risk of wildfires and manage ecosystems. Here are some key points and recommendations related to prescribed burning from the retrieved documents:<br><br><strong>Regulatory Barriers</strong>:<br>- The current air quality regulatory framework can be a barrier to the use of prescribed fire. There are recommendations to revise the Exceptional Events Rule to encourage greater use of prescribed fire and enhance programmatic and procedural ease [doc1].<br>- There is a recommendation to amend the federal Clean Air Act to exclude prescribed fire emissions [doc1].<br><br><strong>Liability Concerns</strong>:<br>- Liability concerns are a significant barrier to the expansion of prescribed burning. Recommendations include adopting a gross negligence standard for third-party damages and clarifying the extent of protection under the Federal Tort Claims Act for Tribes and non-federal cooperators burning on federal lands [doc2].<br>- There is also a recommendation to increase education among agency staff related to potential liability issues and initiate a broader review of the framework for fire-related liability [doc2].<br><br><strong>Permitting and Planning</strong>:<br>- CAL FIRE has taken steps to reduce policies that inhibit beneficial fire use, but further improvements in transparency and permitting processes are recommended. This includes publishing clear criteria for burn permit evaluation and amending sections of the California Public Resources Code to make it easier to obtain permits for broadcast burning [doc4].<br>- Recommendations also include exploring mechanisms to make planning more effective and efficient, such as improved information gathering, training, staffing, collaboration, and programmatic analyses for restoration and hazardous fuels reduction activities [doc4].<br><br><strong>Environmental Review</strong>:<br>- The environmental review process for prescribed burning can be slow and costly. Recommendations include providing agencies additional leeway to rely on equivalent state and/or federal analyses already completed and exploring mechanisms to expedite and improve internal processes [doc5].<br>- There is also a recommendation to modify the examples contained within the CEQA guidelines to better facilitate the applications of such exemptions to prescribed fire [doc5].<br><br>These points highlight the importance of addressing regulatory, liability, permitting, and environmental review barriers to expand the use of prescribed burning effectively."
