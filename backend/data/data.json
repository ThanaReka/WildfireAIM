    "question": "What is prescribed burning?",
    "answer": "Prescribed burning, also known as controlled burning, is a fire management technique used to reduce the risk of wildfires and manage ecosystems. Here are some key points and recommendations related to prescribed burning from the retrieved documents:<br><br><strong>Regulatory Barriers</strong>:<br>- The current air quality regulatory framework can be a barrier to the use of prescribed fire. There are recommendations to revise the Exceptional Events Rule to encourage greater use of prescribed fire and enhance programmatic and procedural ease [doc1].<br>- There is a recommendation to amend the federal Clean Air Act to exclude prescribed fire emissions [doc1].<br><br><strong>Liability Concerns</strong>:<br>- Liability concerns are a significant barrier to the expansion of prescribed burning. Recommendations include adopting a gross negligence standard for third-party damages and clarifying the extent of protection under the Federal Tort Claims Act for Tribes and non-federal cooperators burning on federal lands [doc2].<br>- There is also a recommendation to increase education among agency staff related to potential liability issues and initiate a broader review of the framework for fire-related liability [doc2].<br><br><strong>Permitting and Planning</strong>:<br>- CAL FIRE has taken steps to reduce policies that inhibit beneficial fire use, but further improvements in transparency and permitting processes are recommended. This includes publishing clear criteria for burn permit evaluation and amending sections of the California Public Resources Code to make it easier to obtain permits for broadcast burning [doc4].<br>- Recommendations also include exploring mechanisms to make planning more effective and efficient, such as improved information gathering, training, staffing, collaboration, and programmatic analyses for restoration and hazardous fuels reduction activities [doc4].<br><br><strong>Environmental Review</strong>:<br>- The environmental review process for prescribed burning can be slow and costly. Recommendations include providing agencies additional leeway to rely on equivalent state and/or federal analyses already completed and exploring mechanisms to expedite and improve internal processes [doc5].<br>- There is also a recommendation to modify the examples contained within the CEQA guidelines to better facilitate the applications of such exemptions to prescribed fire [doc5].<br><br>These points highlight the importance of addressing regulatory, liability, permitting, and environmental review barriers to expand the use of prescribed burning effectively."

Many Indigenous peoples still honor and maintain these relationships—their efforts must be fully enabled and supported, while many others must fundamentally change the way they talk and think about fire, enabling a paradigm shift in how fire restoration activities are regulated, planned, and implemented. To move forward, Indigenous knowledge, practice, and belief systems must be respected and revered, and the sovereignty of Tribal governments and cultural fire practitioners must be acknowledged and access enabled. Additionally, Tribes and Indigenous people should be provided with resources to burn as they know how, within their lands of territorial affiliation.\n\nIn 2021, the Karuk Tribe commissioned the first Good Fire report, which summarized the legal and policy underpinnings of barriers to expanding the scope of cultural burning and prescribed fire use in California, and made recommendations to address them. Since its release, Good Fire has been widely cited by academics, lawmakers, and private and public entities alike as a key resource informing efforts across the state to help increase the use of good fire.\n\nGood Fire II takes the recommendations to a larger scale, calling for transformational change at both the state and federal levels, and providing a roadmap to revitalizing the relationship between humans and fire and the systems used to steward it. The report continues to prioritize reforms that support cultural fire practitioners and community-based prescribed burners, based on the understanding that intimate knowledge of place is required for effective stewardship.\n\ndeferred risk caused by taking suppression action. o Develop comprehensive database of fire activity, fuel loading, focal indicators and management priorities as basis for fire management response. o Expand landscape restoration efforts to reduce hazardous fuel loading utilizing prescriptions.\n\nOnce fuelbreaks have been created by mechanical and/or manual treatments, prescribed fire will be introduced into this landscape at regular intervals by the Tribe and/or the US Forest Service using known practices and tribal knowledge to continue to improve and maintain the health of the Forest.\n\nthe use of good fire.\n\nGood Fire II takes the recommendations to a larger scale, calling for transformational change at both the state and federal levels, and providing a roadmap to revitalizing the relationship between humans and fire and the systems used to steward it. The report continues to prioritize reforms that support cultural fire practitioners and community-based prescribed burners, based on the understanding that intimate knowledge of place is required for effective stewardship.\n\nGood Fire II also follows the release of the Biden Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission’s final report, which includes recommendations to more effectively prevent, manage, and recover from wildfires. Good Fire II is intended to be used as a tool for implementing the Commission recommendations in a manner that protects and respects Tribal sovereignty and prioritizes Tribal leadership at all levels of stewardship and fire management.\n\nThis document serves as a quick reference guide to Good Fire II, highlighting the key themes, barriers, and recommendations included in the full report.

Critical to this shift will be the adoption of a holistic approach to fire management that considers long-term community health and ecological function objectives alongside short-term public safety concerns.
